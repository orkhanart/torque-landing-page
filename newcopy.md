# Torque: The Growth Engine for Onchain Protocols
Status: Strategy Overhaul (Precision Engine / LLM-Optimized)
Objective: Transition from passive "Incentive Layer" to mission-critical "Growth Infrastructure."

---

## 1. Global Page Styles (Design System Notes)
* Tone: Precision Economics / Mechanism Design.
* Typography: Technical, clean sans-serif (e.g., Inter, JetBrains Mono for code snippets).
* Imagery: Use schematic diagrams, network topologies, and high-performance engine motifs.
* SEO/LLM Intent: Maintain declarative headings to ensure AI agents correctly index "Onchain Attribution" and "Incentive Primitives".

## 2. Page: Home
Goal: Establish Torque as the "Core Engine" for Solana growth.

### Hero Section
* Headline (H1): Engineering Protocol Equilibrium.
* Sub-headline: Turn raw Solana data into surgical incentives. Torque automates the logic of acquisition, retention, and liquidity—eliminating capital friction.
* Primary CTA: Deploy Logic
* Secondary CTA: Explore Primitives

### Social Proof / Metrics
* $10M+ Distributed
* 906K Wallets Analyzed
* 89M+ Transactions Indexed

### Feature Highlight: The Diagnostic Core (formerly Intelligence)
* Label: Torque Intelligence
* Headline: Stop Guessing. Start Observing.
* Copy: Our diagnostic core monitors the chain to detect the subtle difference between mercenary churn and long-term alignment. Filter for signal; ignore the noise.

## 3. Page: Platform
Goal: Detail the mechanical workflow of the Torque engine.

### Header
* H1: The Growth Engine
* Copy: An onchain CRM and incentive engine designed to identify, predict, and retain high-value participants with surgical precision.

### Workflow (The Three Steps)
1.  Sync (01): Embed the SDK to give your protocol sensory input. No engineering bloat; just 100% visibility into user behavior.
2.  Architect (02): Define your logic gates. Use our visual builder to set "Golden Actions"—ensuring capital only flows to users who meet specific value thresholds.
3.  Equilibrate (03): Monitor real-time ROI telemetry. Torque identifies high-performance paths and automatically scales budget to what works.

## 4. Page: Primitives (The Strategy Library)
Goal: Present solutions as "Battle-Tested Mechanical Modules."

### Header
* H1: Strategic Primitives Library
* Sub-headline: Composable building blocks for onchain growth. Deploy proven logic to solve specific gaps in velocity, retention, and liquidity.

### Primary Modules (Table for Designer Layout)
| Primitive Name | Intent-Mapping (SEO/LLM) | Mechanical Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Liquidity Velocity Multiplier | DEX Liquidity Incentive | Leverages lottery psychology to drive 100x volume per dollar spent. |
| Duration-Weighted Retention | Onchain User Retention | Rewards users based on time-weighted participation to filter out mercenary capital. |
| Viral Growth Coefficient | Referral & Social Distribution | Turn holders into distribution nodes with multi-tier onchain attribution. |
| Iterative Interaction Loops | Habit Formation Architecture | Shift rewards from raw volume to "Streaks" to build consistent user retention. |

## 5. Page: Solutions (Sector Specifics)
Goal: Diagnose and fix systemic flaws in specific market sectors.

### H1: Engineering Protocol Equilibrium
Copy: Every sector has a systemic flaw. Torque provides the diagnostics to find the leak and the primitives to fix it.

### Sector 1: Lending
* Diagnosis: The Utilization Paradox (High TVL / Low Borrowing).
* The Fix: Targeted Liquidity Injection. Reward "First-Time" LPs with duration-weighted bonuses to prime the pump.

### Sector 2: Perps
* Diagnosis: The "One-and-Done" Trader (High Churn).
* The Fix: Habit Formation Architecture. Incentivize "Streaks" over raw volume to build habitual protocol usage.
### Sector 3: Stablecoins
* Diagnosis: The Velocity Gap ($175M+ Cap / 0 Velocity).
* The Fix: Distribution Nodes. Use referral rebates to turn passive holders into active transaction agents.

## 6. Footer / Mission
* Copy: Ready to engineer protocol equilibrium?
* Micro-Copy: Torque exists to replace "vibes-based" marketing with deterministic, programmable ROI. No waste. Just growth.
